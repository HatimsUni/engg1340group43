Game Rules
The game rules for each of the five card games are included in the program.

Features Implemented and Coding Requirements
We implemented the following features and coding requirements to support the game:

1. Generation of random game sets or events: In this game we randomly generated a deck of cards.
2. Data structures for storing game status: We utilized vectors and structures to store the deck and hands.
3. Dynamic memory management: We utilized dynamic memory management mainly through the use of pointers.
4. File input/output (e.g., for loading/saving game status): We created a C++ program with the intended purpose of storing the username, total games played, the score for each game, and the total sums of scores in a txt file. This program also has the ability to print a person's score and update that score.
5. Program codes in multiple files: For each game, we separated the C++ programs into multiple files. Through the use of header files and makefile, we were able to combine all of the files into one executable program.

Non-Standard C/C++ Libraries:
We did not use any non-standard C/C++ libraries.
