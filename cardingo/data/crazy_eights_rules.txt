The basic gameplay of Crazy Eights involves trying to get rid of your cards by matching either the rank or suit of the current card
The objective of the game is to be the first one to discard all your cards
At the start of the game each player are dealt 7 cards
Place the remaining cards face down on the table forming the draw pile and turn the top card over and place it beside the draw pile to start the discard pile
The first player must play a card that matches the suit or rank of the card on the discard pile (e.g. current card is a 7 of hearts, hence player can play any other 7 or any heart card)
If a player cannot play a card, they must keep drawing cards from the draw pile until they found a card they can play and play it
The game's namesake card is the "eight" and when played, the player gets to choose which suit will be played next
The first player to get rid of all their cards wins the game
If the draw pile run out of cards, then the player ties and the game is over
