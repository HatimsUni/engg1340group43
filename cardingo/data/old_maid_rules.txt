Old Maid is a classic card game where the goal of the game is to remove all pairs from your hand while not being left with the queen of spades
A pair is defined of cards with the same value and same color (clubs with spades and diamonds with hearts)
At the start of the game each player draws 26 cards
Whoever starts with the queen of clubs throws it away and the opponent starts first
Each turn the current player will take a card from the opponent's hand and if it results in a pair with a card from their hand, they throw away the pair
The players alternate turns until one player is left with the queen of spades and the other player has no card
The winner is the player with no cards left
The loser is the player with the queen of spades left
